The files in this page are meant to further the understanding of the thesis work that was conducted.
They are taylored specifically to our setup, but may be altered with minor changes to adapt it to different situations. 
The main code is a solving algorithm for any lumped parameter thermal network.
Additionally there are the code files for the methods of determining the heat transfer coefficients k and h.

All spreadsheets may be found in the Experimental-data-and-Conductance-calculations branch and are needed to make the MATLAB code function.
The overview sheet was used to calculate all thermal conductances and capacitances.
The Formatted sheets are the experimental test data collected during our experiments.
